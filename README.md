# Emit
Emit is a simple time tracking app. It is designed and developed to be simple. A user only needs to start the timer when working and stop it when not. Then a prompt will appear on the screen asking for the details about what user did in that period of time. Finally, users can export an excel output for their whole day with all the data in it.


## Run locally
